ATHENE NOCTUA
Bell's Latin Course Gamified

This will be my final project for CS50x.

I became certified to teach high school German, and applied to teach at a variety of schools that are 1:1 computing environments.  I prepared example materials (including a vocab game with "The Lederhosen Guy") for an interactive course website.  Unfortunately, I was not hired.  I do not want the work I started in gamifying language learning to go to waste.  Rather than create a German learning system 100% from scratch (to avoid outdated language with public domain materials, and copyright issues with modern things), I have decided to implement this with my first foreign language: Latin.  It is possible that I will add Ancient Greek after the Latin is fully implemented, since I am personally interested in learning it as well.

I will be using public domain materials, such as Bell's Latin Course and its accompanying readers, as well as Charles E. Bennett's Latin Grammar.  Users will progress through various Levels, which will include grammar and vocab instruction and exercises, as well as sentence composition and translation.  I have developed a basic IME in JavaScript to enable the input of macrons for vowel length.  The website will use Google Authentication for handling sign-in, and user progress will be tracked as levels are unlocked.  The website will also be - an important first for me - built with a completely responsive design to look great and function excellently on desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices.
